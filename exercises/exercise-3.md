# Exercise 3

**Instructions:** Please complete the following requirements ensuring your solution meets all of them. Going above and beyond the requirements is great so long as all of the requirements are met. Before coding anything, please read all of the requirements first. If you are unsure about anything, please ask the instructor.

## Requirements

**Requirement 1.** Create a Car Form model in the `CarTool` component code block.

**Requirement 2.** Add a form to the Car Tool to capture new car data. Do not use the `EditForm` component. Simply bind the model to input fields.

**Requirement 3.** Add an "Add Car" button to the bottom of the form. When the button is clicked, create a new Car model, generate an id, and add the car to the table.

Ensure it works!
